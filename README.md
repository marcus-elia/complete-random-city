# complete-random-city
This program procedurally generates a 3d world that the user can
fly around and explore. It creates roads, buildings, cars, 
planes, skyscrapers, houses, and trees. Hold w,a,s, and d to move
around, and hold r and c to move up or down (respectively). Press
then escape key to close the window. You can also get your cursor
out of the window by moving it very suddenly to either side.

This project uses OpenGL/Glut. If you are on Windows, you will
 need to create a folder called freeglut in 
 C:/Program Files/Common Files. You must download freeglut, and
 in this freeglut folder, put the include and lib folders from
 the download. Then take freeglut.dll from the bin folder in
 the download, and put the dll in your cmake-build-debug folder
 for the project. If you are on Mac, you might be able to just 
 run it. If you are on Linux, I do not know.
 
 If you cannot run it and you are curious to see what it looks
 like, I have put some screenshots in the repository.
